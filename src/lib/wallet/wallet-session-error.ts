// A wallet session that never carried our request is not a request failure
// (ASK-1872). The MWA native module rejects every session-level problem with a
// string `code`, and lifecycle telemetry maps *any* coded error to
// `request_failed` — so "the wallet app never connected back" reached ClickStack
// looking exactly like "the backend returned 500", and paged on-call for a
// failure that never left the device.
//
// The native module's rejection codes (SolanaMobileWalletAdapterModule.kt) are:
//
//   ERROR_WALLET_NOT_FOUND                                  no wallet installed
//   "Timed out waiting for local association to be ready"    10s association wait
//   "Session not established: Local association cancelled…"  user backed out
//   "Timed out waiting for response"                         90s in-session wait
//   EUNSPECIFIED                                             everything else,
//     including the ExecutionException raised when the wallet app never
//     connects back to the local association socket
//
// Every one of those throws `WalletSessionError` so callers can ask
// `isWalletSessionError` instead of matching codes, and telemetry can report
// the actual failure instead of a blanket `request_failed`.
